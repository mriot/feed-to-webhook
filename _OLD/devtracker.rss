			<description>Hey all! I'd like to make sure I understand and hear more about some of the feedback, so I've
				quoted a few posts below and asked the authors to expand on their thoughts.





				Since the changes to Siege Dampener and Siege Disruptor were in separate updates than the wall/gate
				repair change, are those changes you think should be reverted in general, or do you feel they're no
				longer valid changes alongside the other changes made in the last patch?







				For the lowered stats on the Keep Aura, you mentioned that you feel it was overkill, but didn't say
				that's one of the changes that should be reverted. Do you feel it should be, or do you think it should
				be left alone?





				Can you elaborate on your thoughts a bit? I'm interested in what specific changes you're thinking of and
				why they aren't working for you.





				Since catapults have always been usable on inner and outer walls, are you feeling that the recent
				changes caused that to become an issue or do you feel that it's a long-running problem aside from more
				recent updates? Can you talk more about how it feels like a problem?







				For defensive siege not feeling relevant, do you feel that this is fully related to the most recent
				update?







				As far as the suggestion of making some types of siege easier to destroy - namely catapults and flame
				rams - do you feel that the changes to siege disruptors aid this in any way? Is the increased damage to
				siege from disruptors making a difference in your eyes?







				Are the changes to the keep lords just not very impactful, or do you feel as though they've actually
				worsened them in any way? Have you experienced groups trying to play around the new mechanics at all, or
				you just haven't seen it make an impact in fights where players aren't particularly paying attention to
				it?





				Do you feel as though double team attacks have gotten worse since the recent update, or is it an ongoing
				issue you're calling out?</description>

			<title>When do gem store items, like Mount Skins, recycle again?</title>

			<description>Well first of all, congrats on successfully raising your siege turtle! If you haven't already
				found it, the Siege Turtle Advent Pack is currently available, and the Kaineng Lights set contains some
				siege turtle skins as well.



				To touch on your actual question as well, returning items rotate in and out of the gem store every week,
				with a different category rotating each week. You can check the "What's In Stock" section of our gem
				store blog posts, published every Tuesday on our website.



				The current mount selection will rotate on May 24.</description>

				<![CDATA[Jade Tech Offensive & Defensive Overcharge Timers Incorrect & Excessive]]>

			<![CDATA[https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/topic/145464-jade-tech-offensive-defensive-overcharge-timers-incorrect-excessive/?do=findComment&comment=2112557]]>

			<description>Hey everyone, I've been keeping an eye on this conversation and talking to several people on
				the team about this change. I want to let you know first that we will be making an adjustment in an
				upcoming build to reduce the cooldown from 90 seconds to 30 seconds.



				To give some context on this change and what led to it, jade tech offensive and defensive protocol
				effects are intended to give players a temporary boost of power at the start of combat, not to maintain
				those boons permanentlyâ€”which invalidates many skills, traits, relics, and so on.



				We also discovered a bug associated with players having both effects at the same time in a particular
				order, which allowed players to apply the full duration of both boons on demand in certain situations.
				In the April 16 game update, when we corrected the issue, we also adjusted the cooldown to more
				accurately reflect the intent for the jade tech protocol effects.



				However, the change to 90 seconds didn't account for smaller, shorter skirmishes, so while we will not
				reintroduce the bug that prevented the cooldown, we will revert the cooldown to 30 seconds.



				Thank you as always for continuing to share your feedback!</description>

			<description>As we mentioned in our recent blog post, the Guild Wars 2 Live Team has been working for the
				past few years to address player problems and introduce improvements to areas of the game, such as the
				new-player experience, crafting, group encounters, and more.



				Hearing from you, the Guild Wars 2 community, is a big part of this work! I review your QOL requests and
				share them with the Live Team weekly to keep them updated about what's on your mind, and the QOL thread
				has been invaluable for that.



				The previous thread recently passed the 10,000 replies mark and that seems like a good milestone to
				begin a new, less overwhelming thread to collect and track QOL requests. The previous thread can be
				found here for anyone who wants to read past requests.



				Thank you for all of your input on this topic and please keep the QOL requests coming!</description>

			<title>Get In-Game Gold with the "On Wiki of Gold" Project</title>
			<link>
			<![CDATA[https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/topic/145711-get-in-game-gold-with-the-on-wiki-of-gold-project/?do=findComment&comment=2110079]]>
			</link>
			<description>On Wiki of Gold is a player-run project supported by ArenaNet on the official Guild Wars 2
				wiki. Any Guild Wars 2 player can receive in-game gold for contributing to articles listed in the
				project.



				How can I help?



				Log in to your wiki account (or create one), visit the On Wiki of Gold page to see the list of articles
				available for editing, read the guidelines at the top of the page, and create your edit!



				You can improve the nominated article or any article it directly links to. This includes adding missing
				screenshots.
				A nominated article will usually have a suggested edit listed, but that's not requiredâ€”you can improve
				it in any way you like.







				What if I'm not comfortable editing the wiki?



				You can still contribute missing information or screenshots and get credit by using the "Leave Article
				Feedback" tab that's at the top of every wiki article. Community editors will take care of formatting
				and find the best place for it.







				About the Project



				On Wiki of Gold has been ongoing since September 2016, thanks to project organizer @Delsea.2576 .
				In that time, Guild Wars 2 players have contributed and received gold more than 6,700 times.
				The name is a nod to the On Wings of Gold adventure in Tarir, the Forgotten City.
				Most Guild Wars 2 wiki edits are made without taking part in On Wiki of Gold; the project was created to
				help fill in some of the gaps.



				Our thanks go out to Delsea and all the wiki editors in the Guild Wars 2 community for their work on
				this project!</description>

			<description>Bug Fix:




				Fixed an issue that could prevent players from being eligible for some Super Adventure Box Test Zone
				achievements if they completed the requirements before unlocking the Test Zone. The Test Zone
				achievements are no longer locked before the zone is available to a player. Players who are missing an
				achievement they earned will receive it upon entering the Super Adventure Box hub zone.</description>
