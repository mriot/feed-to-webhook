# FTW - Feed to Webhook

This RSS feed aggregator is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi or a similar device, allowing you to monitor RSS feeds and send new posts to [Discord webhooks](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks). It's lightweight, easy to set up, and does not require a database whatsoever.

The frequency of how often feeds are checked is set through a [cronjob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) schedule, which can be adjusted to your liking.

## Features

- Flexible, can parse a wide range of feed types
- [ETag and Last-Modified](https://feedparser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/http-etag.html) support to reduce bandwidth usage
- Customizable embed colors and icons for each feed
- Optional error webhook to get notified of any issues
- Does not consume any resources outside the scheduled runs

## Setup

> ðŸ“Œ Made with Python 3.9 to ensure compatibility with most Raspberry Pis.

- Download this project and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies  
- Edit `config.json` to add your feeds and webhooks
- Run `python src/main.py` once to let it create a `timestamps.json` file
- Check the console output for any errors
- On a Raspberry Pi you can use `crontab -e` to create a cronjob  
  E.g. `*/15 * * * * python3 {path_to_project}/src/main.py` (*every 15th minute*)  
  [Crontab Guru](https://crontab.guru/) can help with the syntax

            "webhooks": [
                "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/0123456789/acbdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz",
                "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/9876543210/acbdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"

## Embed design

Most embeds consist of an icon along with the feed's title, a heading to the article, some text, and an image. In the footer, you'll find the feed's source and the date of the article.

- The icon typically comes from the feed itself (or defaults to the website's favicon), but you can override this in the config to use a custom icon.

- If any images are found within the article, the first one will be used as the embed's image.
